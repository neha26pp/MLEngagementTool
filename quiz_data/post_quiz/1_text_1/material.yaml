    - "<p>Here at ESA the European Space Agency - space is our business. It's a place we explore, heading outwards while also looking back to improve life on our own blue planet. Here's what you need to know about the stuff that surrounds us. Planet Earth with its air, comfortable gravity and life is unusual. Most of the other 99.9999 percent of the universe is just space. If your car could drive vertically, it would reach the altitude where the lowest satellites fly within a couple of hours. If you go straight up, gravity will only pull you down again. The gravitational pull at the orbit of the International Space Station is still 90 percent of that at Earth's surface. Going into space means moving horizontally, but doing it very fast - 400 times faster than a car - to about eight kilometres per second. So, when rockets lift off, you really see them turning sideways - not flying straight. Earth's gravity is still pulling on you, but you're moving so fast you fall around the world instead of hitting it. This is called an 'orbit'. The orbit you need depends on what you want to do in space. A lot of our work comes down to improving life on Earth. Fly close for sharp-eyed, environmental monitoring; higher orbits for navigation satellites, covering more of the planet at once. The farther you orbit away from Earth, the lower gravity's pull. So, the slower you fly to overcome it. Weather and communication satellites are in geostationary orbit around the Equator, keeping pace with Earth's rotation to stay at a single spot in the sky looking at the same place on the ground. Earth orbit is only the start. With a big enough push of power, you can escape altogether. This shifts you to solar orbit, free to go to other places also orbiting the Sun - the other worlds and planetoids of our solar system. To go into orbit: that takes rocket power. Basically, a controlled explosion in a single direction.</p>"
